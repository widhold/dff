# dff: Dogs, Frogs &amp; Faces

Short: I created a quick art project with pictures emerging (bursting) out of the previous picture. You can see the result here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dyp8TPwYdc

Long: After a festival, I drove home but was very tired, so I stopped in a parking lot to rest. For about one hour, when I closed my eyes, I saw a continuous stream of faces—horrible faces—that burst out of the previous one. At any time, I could open my eyes and stop seeing it. But seconds after closing, it started again. I have no idea where this came from; I do not take drugs. I guess I was just very exhausted. However, after having this experience, I wanted to create a video that simulated what I saw. I did not find any transitions in Premiere Pro, so I wrote the code myself.

Please note: The code is not very good; it was very slow, so I even used multiprocessing to improve the speed. It is not real-time, which was the goal. Perhaps you can find a solution that improves the speed and efficiency? I used CUDA, but the "set up costs" made it even slower. Perhaps Python has not been the best choice.
